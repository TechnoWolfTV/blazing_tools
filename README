Adds the usual collection of tools at high strength and speed made from the "blazing" block.

Crafting

* A blazing block can be crafted from one lump of coal, one regular stick, one
  gold ingot and one bucket of lava. Empty buckets are returned upon crafting.
  Blazing blocks emit light.

* Blazing tools can be crafted using the same standard recipes used by other
  tools, substituting blazing blocks for the tool heads.

Mod Compatibility

* Blazing tools emit light if the wielded_light mod is also installed.
* Blazing tools can be enchanted if the x_enchanting mod is also installed.
